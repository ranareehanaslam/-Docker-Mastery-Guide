# üê≥ Docker Mastery Guide

Welcome to the **Docker Mastery Guide**, your ultimate resource for diving deep into the world of Docker. Designed for enthusiasts at every skill level, this guide lays the foundation for Docker usage and best practices, dives into advanced topics, and unveils the potential of Docker in both DevOps and MLOps landscapes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Docker revolutionizes the way we build, share, and run applications, allowing developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. This guide is your beacon through the Docker universe, from basic concepts to the orchestration of complex applications with Docker Compose and integration into machine learning operations and DevOps workflows.

## Docker Images

![Docker Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranareehanaslam/Docker-Mastery-Guide/main/images/Docker%20Image%20-2.jpg)

Docker images are lightweight, standalone, executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

### Key Commands:
- Build an image: `docker build -t myapp .`
- List all images: `docker images`
- Pull an image: `docker pull nginx:latest`
- Tag an image: `docker tag myapp:latest myapp:v1`

## Docker Containers

![Docker Containers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranareehanaslam/Docker-Mastery-Guide/main/images/Docker%20Container-3.jpg)

A Docker container is a runtime instance of an image. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

### Key Operations:
- Run a container: `docker run -d --name my_container myapp`
- List running containers: `docker ps`
- Execute a command in a container: `docker exec -it my_container /bin/bash`
- Stop and remove a container: `docker stop my_container; docker rm my_container`

## Docker Volumes and Networking

![Docker Volumes and Networking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranareehanaslam/Docker-Mastery-Guide/main/images/Docker%20Volume%20and%20Network-4.jpg)

Docker volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Docker networking enables containers to communicate with each other and with other external networks.

### Volumes:
- Create a volume: `docker volume create my_volume`
- List volumes: `docker volume ls`

### Networking:
- Create a network: `docker network create --driver bridge my_network`
- Connect a container to a network: `docker network connect my_network my_container`

## Docker Compose

![Docker Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranareehanaslam/Docker-Mastery-Guide/main/images/Docker%20Compose-5.jpg)

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application‚Äôs services, networks, and volumes.

### Core Features:
- Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
- Run `docker-compose up`, and Compose starts and runs your entire app.

## Latest Docker Features

Stay ahead of the curve by leveraging Docker's latest features, designed to improve your development workflow and enhance your applications' scalability and security.

### New Additions:
- Docker Init: Initialize your application with a simple command.
- Docker Watch: Automatically rebuilds and refreshes containers as files change.

## Dockerfile Reference

![Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranareehanaslam/Docker-Mastery-Guide/main/images/Docker%20Reffernce-7.jpg)

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build` users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

### Sample Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This Dockerfile example showcases the setup of a simple Python application, illustrating the use of base images, working directories, copying files, installing dependencies, exposing ports, setting environment variables, and specifying the command to run the application.

## Docker Compose File Reference

![Docker Compose File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranareehanaslam/Docker-Mastery-Guide/main/images/Docker%20Compose%20Reffernce-8.jpg)

A Docker Compose file is a YAML file that defines services, networks, and volumes for Docker applications.

### Sample `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - web-data:/var/www/html
  database:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example

volumes:
  web-data:

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

This example demonstrates defining a simple web application and database service, specifying the use of images, ports, volumes, and custom networks. It provides a practical approach to orchestrating containers that work together.
